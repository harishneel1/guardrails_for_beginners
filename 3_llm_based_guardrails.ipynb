    "# Notebook 3: LLM-as-a-Judge Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We've Learned So Far:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook 1: Rule-Based Guardrails**\n",
    "- ✅ Fast and predictable\n",
    "- ❌ Easy to bypass with variations\n",
    "- ❌ High maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook 2: ML-Based Guardrails (Guardrails AI)**\n",
    "- ✅ More robust than rules\n",
    "- ✅ Pre-built validators for common risks\n",
    "- ❌ Limited to what they're trained for\n",
    "- ❌ Can't handle new/custom risks\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Next Level: LLM-as-a-Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:** Use another LLM to evaluate inputs/outputs for safety\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- ✅ Flexible - can check for ANY custom risk\n",
    "- ✅ Understands context and nuance\n",
    "- ✅ No training needed - just write good prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- ❌ Slower (adds latency - another LLM call)\n",
    "- ❌ More expensive (API costs multiply)\n",
    "- ❌ Less predictable than ML models\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use:**\n",
    "- Custom business rules (e.g., \"don't mention competitors\")\n",
    "- Domain-specific risks (e.g., medical advice detection)\n",
    "- Complex judgments that need reasoning"
